# Laravel README

This README file provides a step-by-step guide to set up and run a Laravel application.

## Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` using the following command:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and update the following database configurations according to your setup:
   ```dotenv
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
   DB_USERNAME=your-username
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

3. Update Composer by running the following command:
   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Run the database migrations and seed the database with initial data:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

## Run the Server

To start the server, use the following command:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will launch the application and make it accessible at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
